        "________________________________________________________________________________--> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that is based on the concept of \"objects\", which are instances of classes. A class is like a blueprint that defines the structure and behavior (data and functions) that its objects will have. OOP helps in organizing complex programs by grouping related data and functions together.\n",
        "\n",
        "It includes key concepts such as encapsulation, which means hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only what is necessary;\n",

By using OOP, programmers can write reusable, maintainable, and modular code that mirrors real-world entities and relationships, making software development more efficient and easier to manage.\n",

It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have. A class does not hold any data itself but acts as a model for objects. For example, if we have a class called Car, it might have attributes like color, brand, and speed, and methods like drive() and brake(). When we create an object like my_car = Car(), it will have its own copy of those attributes and can use the methods defined in the class. Classes help organize code and make it reusable and easier to manage.\n",

While a class is just a blueprint, an object is the actual implementation based on that blueprint. Each object has its own separate values for the attributes defined in the class. For example, if there is a class Car, then car1 and car2 can be two different objects of that class, each with different colors or brands. Objects allow programmers to model real-life things in code, making programs more organized, modular, and easier to understand.\n",

Dunder methods are used to define how objects of a class behave with built-in Python functions and operators. For example, the __init__ method is called automatically when a new object is created, and __str__ defines what should be displayed when the object is printed. These methods allow you to customize class behavior in a powerful and flexible way.\n",

        "\n",
        "The main purpose of inheritance is code reusability. Instead of writing the same code again, you can define it once in a parent class and let child classes use or extend it. Inheritance also helps in building a logical class hierarchy, making the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",

        "________________________________________________________________________________\n",

        "\n",
        "However, in Python, true method overloading is not supported like in other languages such as Java or C++. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a class, only the last one will be used, and the previous ones will be overwritten.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, Python achieves method overloading using default arguments, *args, and **kwargs, which allow a method to accept a variable number of arguments.\n",

        "-->> Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it adds flexibility, reusability, and scalability to the code.

        "\n",
        "2. Modularity\n",
        "OOP organizes code into classes and objects, making it easier to manage, update, and debug. Each class is like a separate module.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Encapsulation\n",
        "With encapsulation, internal object details are hidden, and access is controlled using methods. This makes the code more secure and maintainable.\n",

        "6. Easier Maintenance\n",
        "Since OOP separates data and functionality into classes, it's easier to update and maintain parts of the program without affecting the entire codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Real-world Modeling\n",
        "OOP models real-world entities as objects, making it easier to design software that is intuitive and close to human thinking.\n",
